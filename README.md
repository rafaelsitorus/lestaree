## 1. Project Title & Tagline
**Lestaree** - _From Renewable to responsible, Lestaree It!_

Lestaree is a tech-based sustainability platform that maps renewable energy potential and its environmental waste footprint across Indonesia. We go beyond clean energy generation—by forecasting not only energy output, but also the byproducts it leaves behind on air, water, and soil and leads to AI-based recommendations.

## 2. Project Description
* Problem Addressed & Its Impact on Indonesia
Indonesia holds over 340 GW of renewable energy potential—from solar, wind, and hydro—yet uses less than 2% of it effectively.
The country’s ambition to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050 is hindered by:
    * **Poor integration and planning systems**
    * **Low public awareness** of renewable waste*
    * **Lack of access to energy and environmental data**
    * A **growing waste problem** from renewable tech (e.g., solar e-waste, wind blade waste, toxic batteries)

    This results in unsustainable expansion, policy inefficiencies, and limited stakeholder action, slowing down Indonesia’s transition to clean energy.
* Our Innovative Solution & How It Works

    **Lestaree** is an AI-powered sustainability platform that:
    * Maps solar, wind, and hydro energy potential across Indonesia
    * Predicts energy output and forecasts environmental waste footprints
    * Visualizes insights through interactive dashboards
    * Guides decision-makers with a built-in AI chatbot that provides:
        * Tailored waste reduction strategies
        * Site-specific suggestions
        * Policy-aligned recommendations

    Lestaree serves as a bridge between data and action, empowering:
    * Citizens with awareness
    * Businesses with smarter planning
